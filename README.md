# Abstract

High-dimensional gene expression data present significant challenges for traditional
statistical tools, particularly when dealing with non-linear relationships and outliers. This study
addresses these complexities by employing a generalized correlation coefficient (GCC) that incorpo-
rates a flexibility parameter, allowing it to adapt to varying levels of symmetry and asymmetry in
the data. This adaptability is crucial for analyzing gene association networks, where the proposed
GCC demonstrates advantages over traditional measures such as Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman
coefficients. We introduce two novel adaptations of this metric, enhancing its precision and broaden-
ing its applicability in the context of complex gene interactions. By applying the GCC to relevance
networks, we show how different levels of the flexibility parameter reveal distinct patterns in gene
interactions, capturing both symmetric and asymmetric relationships. The maximum likelihood
and Spearman-based estimators of the GCC offer a refined approach for disentangling the complex-
ity of biological networks, with potential implications for precision medicine. This methodology
contributes a powerful tool for constructing and interpreting relevance networks in biomedicine,
supporting advancements in the understanding of biological interactions and healthcare research
